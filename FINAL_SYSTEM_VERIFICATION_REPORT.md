# FINAL FULL-SYSTEM VERIFICATION REPORT
## Admin App vs AdminAppBluePrintTruth.md

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Scope:** Flutter Admin App — production readiness against blueprint (absolute source of truth)  
**Rules:** Verification only — no code changes, no suggestions, strict compliance check.

---

## 1. FULL FEATURE VERIFICATION

### 1.1 Design & Auth (§1–§2)

| Blueprint requirement | Status | Notes / File ref |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------|
| PIN login (Owner/Manager only) | ✅ | `pin_screen.dart`: PIN verified against `staff_profiles`, `.inFilter('role', AdminConfig.allowedRoles)` |
| Rejection message "Access restricted to Admin staff." | ✅ | `pin_screen.dart` L198 |
| Cashier/Blockman rejected | ✅ | `admin_config.dart`: `allowedRoles = ['owner','manager']` |
| Role routing: Owner full, Manager limited | ⚠️ | Nav hides Bookkeeping & Settings for non-owner (`main_shell.dart`). Manager-specific limits (e.g. Payroll ❌, Reports operational only) not enforced per-screen — many target screens missing. |

### 1.2 Main Dashboard (§3)

| Widget | Status | Notes / File ref |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Today's Sales | ✅ | `dashboard_screen.dart`, `DashboardRepository.getTodayStats()` |
| Transaction Count | ✅ | Same |
| Average Basket | ✅ | Same |
| Gross Margin | ✅ | Same (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue |
| Real-time (Supabase subscription) | ❌ | No subscription; load on init + pull-to-refresh only. Blueprint: "Real-time (Supabase subscription)". |
| Alerts (shrinkage, reorder, overdue, leave) | ⚠️ | Queries present. **Shrinkage:** `.eq('resolved', false)` — migrations do not define `shrinkage_alerts` table; trigger in 003 inserts `batch_id, expected_weight, actual_weight, shrinkage_percentage, alert_type`. If table has no `resolved` column, query fails. Dashboard displays `a['item_name']` but trigger does not insert `item_name` → "Unknown item" or runtime error. |
| Sales Chart (7-day aggregate) | ❌ | Not implemented. Dashboard has stats row + alerts + clock-in only; no chart widget. |
| Staff Clock-In status | ✅ | `_loadClockInStatus()` from `timecards` + `staff_profiles` |
| Overdue accounts alert | ⚠️ | Queries `business_accounts` with `balance > 0` only; no due-date vs today → no "X days overdue" calculation per blueprint. |

### 1.3 Inventory (§4)

| Feature | Status | Notes / File ref |

| Suppliers (list + form) | ✅ | `supplier_list_screen.dart`, `supplier_form_screen.dart` |
| Stock-Take (multi-device) | ✅ | `stock_take_screen.dart` (tab) |
| Stock Levels (§4.4) | ❌ | Tab exists but content is `_StockLevelsPlaceholderScreen` — placeholder only; no table view across locations. |

## 2. END-TO-END WORKFLOW VALIDATION

| Workflow | Verdict | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|
| POS sale → completion | N/A (POS app) | Admin reads transactions; not driving sale. |
| Inventory update after sale | ⚠️ | POS writes transactions; Admin reads. Stock deduction is POS/backend — not verified in Admin codebase. |
| Account charging flow | ⚠️ | Account list exists; no account detail/statement flow → cannot validate full charge → payment → statement. |
| Loyalty interaction | ⚠️ | Customer list only; no loyalty-specific UI per blueprint. |
| Admin reporting flows | ⚠️ | Report hub exists; ledger/P&L/cash flow missing → financial reporting incomplete. |
| Carcass intake → breakdown → stock | ✅ | Production tabs present; actual RPC/stock_movements not traced. |
| Invoice → ledger → P&L | ❌ | Ledger and P&L screens missing; flow broken. |

---

## 3. LOGIC INTEGRITY CHECK

| Area | Finding | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Pricing | Not fully verified; pricing tab in Analytics present. | LOW |
| Discounts | Not verified in Admin (POS-centric). | LOW |
| Stock deductions | Trigger/schema for shrinkage_alerts may not match dashboard (resolved vs status; item_name missing in trigger). | **HIGH** |
| Account handling | Overdue alert does not compute "X days overdue"; auto-suspend logic not confirmed in UI. | MEDIUM |
| Dashboard stats | Today/yesterday comparison and margin calculation match blueprint. | OK |

---

## 4. SYSTEM INTEGRATION VALIDATION

| Integration | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Admin → POS (products, prices, staff, modifiers, tax) | ⚠️ | Admin writes to Supabase; POS reads. Not verified E2E. |
| POS → Admin (transactions, till sessions, audit) | ✅ | Dashboard/reports read `transactions`; repository uses same. |
| POS ↔ Inventory | ⚠️ | Product/category management in Admin; Stock Levels placeholder only. |
| POS ↔ Accounts | ⚠️ | Account list exists; statement and payment recording flow incomplete. |
| Ledger as single source of truth | ❌ | Ledger screen and CoA missing; bookkeeping integration incomplete. |

---

## 5. DATA & STATE CONSISTENCY

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|------|
| Models vs blueprint | ⚠️ | Core has 6 models (transaction, transaction_item, ledger_entry, stock_movement, shrinkage_alert, base_model). Blueprint lists many more in core (e.g. inventory_item, carcass_intake, yield_template, staff_profile, business_account, invoice). Some live in feature folders (e.g. production/models). |
| shrinkage_alerts schema | ⚠️ | Dashboard uses `resolved`; analytics uses `status`. Trigger (003) inserts batch_id, expected_weight, actual_weight, shrinkage_percentage, alert_type — no `resolved` or `item_name`. Table definition not in 001/002; risk of missing column or wrong filter. |
| Supabase init (Rule 1) | ✅ | Single init in SupabaseService.initialize(); not in main/blocs/repos. |
| Supabase project (Rule 2) | Not verified | No scan for forbidden project ID in this run. |

---

## 6. UI FLOW & SCREEN COVERAGE

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| All required sidebar items present | ✅ Dashboard, Inventory, Production, Hunter, HR, Accounts, Bookkeeping (owner), Analytics, Reports, Customers, Audit, Settings (owner). |
| Production sub-navigation | ✅ Single route opens CarcassIntakeScreen with 6 tabs (Yield, Carcass Intake, Pending Breakdowns, Recipes, Batches, Dryer). |
| Inventory sub-navigation | ✅ Tab bar: Categories, Products, Modifiers, Suppliers, Stock-Take, Stock Levels (last is placeholder). |
| Dead ends | Product form "coming soon"; Stock Levels placeholder; Hunter → only list (no intake/process/summary); HR → only list; Accounts → no detail/statement; Bookkeeping → only invoices; Settings → only business; Customers → no announcements/recipe library. |
| Manager vs Owner nav | ✅ Bookkeeping and Settings hidden for non-owner. |

---

## 7. EDGE CASE & FAILURE HANDLING

| Area | Finding | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Empty states | Partial (e.g. dashboard "No alerts — all clear", "No staff profiles found"). Not verified per screen. | LOW |
| Invalid inputs | Not systematically verified. | LOW |
| Failed transactions / API errors | Dashboard/repos use try/catch and debugPrint; some UI show SnackBar. No consistent pattern. | MEDIUM |
| Partial flows | Ledger/P&L missing → month-end and accountant handover incomplete. | **HIGH** |

---

## 8. PRODUCTION RISK CHECK

| Risk | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Shrinkage alerts query/schema mismatch | **CRITICAL** | If `shrinkage_alerts` has no `resolved` column, dashboard query fails. If no `item_name`, display wrong or crash. |
| No ledger / P&L / VAT / cash flow | **CRITICAL** | Financial close and compliance (VAT, P&L) cannot be done in app. |
| No payroll / staff credit / compliance | **HIGH** | Payroll and BCEA compliance not deliverable. |
| Overdue accounts logic incomplete | **HIGH** | No "X days overdue" or per-account auto-suspend UI → wrong decisions or missed suspensions. |
| Product form missing | **HIGH** | Cannot add/edit products per blueprint; inventory management incomplete. |
| Stock Levels placeholder | **HIGH** | No visibility of stock across locations. |
| Missing HR (timecards, leave, AWOL, staff credit) | **HIGH** | HR operations and audit trail incomplete. |
| Missing Bookkeeping (ledger, CoA, equipment, PTY) | **HIGH** | Full bookkeeping and PTY conversion not possible. |
| Dashboard not real-time, no 7-day chart | MEDIUM | Operational visibility below blueprint. |
| Manager permissions not enforced per screen | MEDIUM | Payroll/Bookkeeping hidden in nav but target screens missing; when added, must enforce. |

## 9. COMPLETION VERDICT

### ✅ FINAL STATUS: **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The application implements a subset of the blueprint (auth, dashboard stats/alerts/clock-in, inventory categories/products list/modifiers/suppliers/stock-take, full production tabs, hunter job list, staff list, account list, invoice list/form, analytics tabs, report hub, customer list, audit log, business settings) but **omits critical screens and flows** required for financial close, HR, and full inventory. **Schema and filter mismatches** (shrinkage_alerts) and **incomplete business logic** (overdue accounts) add risk.

---

### 📊 COMPLETION SCORE (by blueprint section)

| Module | Completion | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| §1–2 Design & Auth | ~95% | Role routing partial (screens missing). |
| §3 Dashboard | ~70% | No real-time, no 7-day chart; alerts schema risk. |
| §4 Inventory | ~65% | No product form, Stock Levels placeholder, no movement log. |
| §5 Production | ~95% | All 6 tabs present; role (yield view-only for Manager) not verified. |
| §6 Hunter | ~20% | Job list only; no config, intake, process, summary. |
| §7 HR | ~15% | Staff list only; no form, timecards, leave, AWOL, payroll, staff credit, compliance. |
| §8 Accounts | ~40% | List only; no detail, statement, full overdue/auto-suspend UI. |
| §9 Bookkeeping | ~25% | Invoices only; no ledger, CoA, P&L, VAT, cash flow, equipment, PTY. |
| §10 Analytics | ~90% | All four areas as tabs; schema/API details not fully verified. |
| §11 Reports | ~85% | Hub + export; scheduling structure present. |
| §12 Customers | ~35% | List only; no announcements, recipe library. |
| §13 Audit | ~90% | Log viewer present. |
| §14 Settings | ~25% | Business only; no scale, tax, notification. |

**Overall (weighted by criticality): ~50%** — many high-impact areas (Bookkeeping, HR, Inventory product/stock levels, Accounts detail/statement) incomplete.

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL FAILURES

1. **shrinkage_alerts** — Dashboard filters on `resolved` and displays `item_name`; trigger and schema may not provide these. **Risk:** runtime error or wrong data.
2. **No Ledger / Chart of Accounts / P&L / VAT / Cash flow** — Bookkeeping cannot support month-end or accountant handover per blueprint.
3. **No Product Add/Edit form** — Full product management (§4.2) not possible.
4. **Stock Levels** — Placeholder only; no table view across locations.

---

### ⚠️ REMAINING GAPS (high level)

- **Screens:** Ledger, Chart of Accounts, P&L, VAT report, Cash flow, Equipment register, PTY conversion; Account detail, Statement; Staff form, Timecard, Leave, AWOL, Payroll, Staff Credit, Compliance; Hunter (service config, intake, process, summary); Scale/Tax/Notification settings; Announcements, Recipe library; Product form; Stock Levels (real view).
- **Dashboard:** Real-time subscription for today’s sales; 7-day sales chart; Overdue accounts "X days overdue" and per-account auto-suspend configuration.
- **Data/Schema:** Align `shrinkage_alerts` table and trigger with dashboard (resolved vs status; item_name or join).
- **Role:** Enforce Manager vs Owner per screen (e.g. Payroll owner-only, Yield view-only for Manager) when those screens exist.
