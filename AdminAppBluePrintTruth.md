APP 2: ADMIN & BACK-OFFICE APPLICATION
COMPLETE BLUEPRINT — VERSION 2.0 (UPDATED)
The Butchery OS — Management, Production, Inventory, HR, Reports


Platform
	Windows 10/11 Desktop
	Framework
	Flutter Desktop (Dart)
	Users
	Owner (full access), Manager (limited access)
	Database
	Supabase (PostgreSQL) — online required for most functions
	Local Cache
	Isar (for production workflows that need offline)
	Integration
	Reads POS transaction data; writes product/price data that POS consumes
	Version
	v2.0 — Updated February 2026 | PTY Ltd Effective: 1 March 2026
	

📌 NOTE: This app is SEPARATE from the POS. It manages everything BEHIND the counter: inventory, production, staff, finances, analytics. The POS only sells.

4.2 Product Management (PLU Management)
Sidebar → 🥩 Inventory → Products

* 2. All active devices (tablets, phones running Stock-Take App) see the open session
* 3. Each counter selects their physical location (Display Fridge 1, Walk-In Fridge, Deep Freezer 4, etc.)
* 4. Multiple counters can log the same PLU from different locations simultaneously
* 5. Live progress visible to Manager/Owner: '38 of 120 items counted (3 devices active)'
* 6. Enter actual quantities — system shows expected vs actual with variance:

* 8. Manager/Owner reviews consolidated totals before approving
* 9. On approval: stock adjusted to physical counts; all variances logged to stock_movements + audit_logs
* 10. Triggers shrinkage analysis after approval


5. PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
5.1 Yield Templates
Sidebar → 🔪 Production → Yield Templates
Owner defines how each carcass type should break down.


🔄 CHANGED: Yield templates are initially set by the owner based on experience and expected averages. Over time, as carcasses are broken down and cuts are sold, the system calculates the TRUE running average from real data. Block tests (full mid-breakdown audit weighing) are optional, not mandatory — the system builds its own intelligence from daily operations.


* Phase 1: Owner creates template with estimated yield percentages per cut
* Phase 2: Each carcass breakdown logs actual weights per cut
* Phase 3: System calculates rolling actual average (last 10 breakdowns per carcass type)
* Phase 4: Owner views 'Suggested Template Update' — can accept or keep manual settings
* Phase 5: System flags when actual consistently differs from template by >5%

Price Multiplier: If carcass cost = R75/kg, T-Bone sell price = R75 × 1.6 = R120/kg.
Multiple templates per carcass type (Standard, Premium, Steak-Heavy, Budget). Owner selects which template to use for each breakdown.


📌 NOTE: TWO separate lamb templates are required: 'Whole Lamb — Premium' and 'Whole Lamb — AB/B3 Grade'. These are different quality grades bought at different cost prices, sold at different price points, requiring separate yield templates.

Dryer Batch Workflow
* Owner/Manager: Production → Dryer Batches → 'New Batch'
* Select Product Type: Biltong / Droewors / Chilli Bites / Other
* Select recipe (pre-set by owner with spice ratios, curing method, expected drying time)
* Enter raw material: product + weight going into dryer
* Enter spices, vinegar, casings used (auto-suggested from recipe)
* 'Load Dryer' → batch status: Drying — records which day it went in
* Drying period tracked: alert when minimum drying time reached ('Batch ready to weigh out')
* Blockman weighs out: enters actual output weight
* System calculates yield % actual vs expected — logs to Blockman performance
* Finished product stock added to inventory
* Raw material stock deducted at batch start (or confirmed at completion)


📌 NOTE: Droewors uses the same dryer batch module as biltong. The difference is the recipe (mince + casings + spice mix vs whole muscle + salt + vinegar) and shorter drying time. Both track: input weight, spice/casing usage, drying days, output weight, yield efficiency, and cost per kg produced.


6. HUNTER JOB MANAGEMENT (FULL CUSTOM SYSTEM)

  Select Services:
  ☑  Cut & Pack (Basic)      R25/kg — for meat portions
  ☑  Make Droewors           R35/kg — customer wants all extras as droewors
  ☐  Make Biltong            R40/kg
  ☐  Make Boerewors          R30/kg
  ☑  Vacuum Seal             R15/pack — for all final packs


  Estimated Total: (45kg × R25) + (est. 15kg × R35) + (20 packs × R15) = R2,150

7.5 Staff Loans, Advances & Meat Purchases on Credit
🔄 CHANGED: All staff loans, salary advances, and meat/product purchases on credit are tracked in one Staff Credit ledger per employee. All deductions are automatic from the next payroll run.

8.5 Overdue Management
🔄 CHANGED: Auto-suspend is NOT the default. The system alerts on overdue but NEVER auto-suspends unless the owner has specifically enabled it for that individual account. Some clients can run overdue indefinitely — that is the owner's business relationship decision.


Overdue Period
	System Action
	Configurable?
	1 day overdue
	🟡 Yellow alert on dashboard only
	No — always on
	7 days overdue
	🔴 Red alert on dashboard + optional email/WhatsApp to Owner

	Auto-suspend
	❌ DOES NOT activate by default
	🔄 Owner enables per account individually. Off by default for all accounts.
	Manual suspend
	Owner clicks 'Suspend Account' in Admin panel
	Always available to owner at any time
	Re-enable
	Owner clicks 'Re-enable Account' in Admin panel
	Always available — immediate effect at POS
	

📌 NOTE: Auto-suspend can be set per individual account with a custom trigger (7 days / 14 days / 30 days). Some long-standing clients may never be suspended — the owner controls this completely per client relationship.


9. BOOKKEEPING & FINANCIAL
9.1 Invoice Management (OCR + Manual + Bulk Import)
Sidebar → 📒 Bookkeeping → Invoices
OCR Flow (Google Drive + Cloud Vision)
* 1. Owner photos supplier invoice OR drops PDF into designated Google Drive folder
* 2. Supabase Edge Function monitors folder (webhook or cron)
* 3. Cloud Vision OCR extracts text
* 4. AI parses: supplier name, invoice #, date, line items, totals
* 5. Invoice appears in Admin with status 'Pending Review'
* 6. Owner reviews, corrects any OCR errors, approves
* 7. Creates invoice + invoice_line_items records
* 8. Detects if supplier has changed prices since last invoice
* 9. Auto-creates Accounts Payable ledger entry


Manual Invoice Entry
* 'Add Invoice Manually' — for when OCR fails or invoice is verbal
* Enter supplier, date, line items, amounts
* Same approval flow as OCR


Bulk CSV Import / Export (NEW)
✅ NEW: Bulk CSV import and export for invoices — essential for accountant handover and month-end processing.
* Import: Upload CSV of multiple invoices — system maps columns and creates entries in bulk
* Export: Export all invoices or filtered selection to CSV for accountant
* Template download: Owner can download the correct CSV template for import
* Duplicate detection: System warns if invoice number already exists before importing
* Export formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx), PDF


9.2 Chart of Accounts (Editable Ledger)
🔄 CHANGED: The chart of accounts is fully editable by the owner. New accounts can be added, existing ones renamed. Accounts cannot be deleted if they have transactions — they can only be deactivated.

10. SMART ANALYTICS & COMPLIANCE
10.1 Shrinkage Detection
Sidebar → 📈 Analytics → Shrinkage
Mass-balance calculation runs nightly:
  For each product:
  Theoretical Stock = Opening + Purchases + Production − Sales − Logged Waste − Moisture Loss
  Actual Stock      = Last stock-take count (or system running total)
  Gap               = Theoretical − Actual
  If Gap > threshold → Alert created


  SHRINKAGE ALERTS — This Week
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  🔴  T-Bone Steak — Gap: 2.4 kg (27%)
      Theoretical: 8.9 kg | On-hand: 6.5 kg
      Possible: Theft, unlogged waste, label error
      Staff involved: Mike (breakdown), Sarah (12 sales)
      [INVESTIGATE]  [CONDUCT STOCK-TAKE]  [ACCEPT & NOTE]


  🟡  Boerewors — Gap: 0.8 kg (6%)
      Possible: Moisture loss, tasting, scale variance
      [ACCEPT & NOTE]


  ✅  Mince — Gap: 0.3 kg (0.5%)
      Normal variance — auto-accepted


10.2 Dynamic Pricing Recommendations
Trigger 1: Supplier price change detected (via OCR or manual entry):
  PRICE ALERT: Beef Forequarter
  Supplier increased: R62/kg → R68/kg (+9.7%)
  Current sell prices affected:
    Mince:  R85/kg — Margin now 20% (was 27%)
    Stew:   R75/kg — Margin now 10% (was 17%)
  Recommended new prices (30% target margin):
    Mince:  R98/kg
    Stew:   R88/kg
  [ACCEPT ALL]  [ADJUST INDIVIDUALLY]  [IGNORE]


Trigger 2: Items approaching expiry / slow-moving:
🔄 CHANGED: Slow-moving trigger days are set per product individually (not system-wide), because shelf life varies enormously across the range. T-Bone may be slow after 3 days; biltong slow after 14 days; spice sachets slow after 45 days.


  MARKDOWN SUGGESTION:
  Lamb Chops — 3.2 kg in stock, only 0.5 kg sold in 3 days
  (Slow-mover trigger for this product: 3 days)
  Sell-by date: 09 Feb 2026 (3 days remaining)
  Suggestion: 20% markdown (R140 → R112) to move stock
  [APPLY]  [DIFFERENT %]  [IGNORE]


10.3 Predictive Reorder Recommendations
Based on sales velocity + current stock + lead time:
  REORDER RECOMMENDATIONS
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  🔴  T-Bone:    2.3 days of stock left → Order NOW (3-day lead time)
  🟡  Rump:      5.1 days of stock left → Order by Friday
  ✅  Mince:     8.4 days of stock left → OK for now
  🔴  Boerewors: 1.1 days of stock left → URGENT (below safety stock)
  [CREATE PURCHASE ORDER]


10.4 Event & Holiday Sales Intelligence (NEW)
✅ NEW: Struisbaai is a holiday and event town. Extreme seasonal peaks are tracked, tagged, and used to generate intelligent pre-event stock and production forecasts.


Event Tagging
* When a day records sales significantly above the rolling average (threshold: owner-configurable, e.g., 200% of normal), system prompts: 'Unusual sales volume detected for [Date]. Was this a specific event or holiday?'
* Owner selects: Public Holiday / Local Event / School Holidays / Easter / Year-End / New Year / Other
* Free-text field: 'Describe event' (e.g. 'Struisbaai Sardine Festival', 'Easter Weekend', 'December Festive Rush')
* Tagged day stored as named event in calendar — used for future forecasting


What the System Tracks Per Event
Data Point
	Purpose
	Total sales value for the event period
	Revenue planning
	Top 20 products by volume and value
	Stock preparation
	Sales by hour of day
	Staffing and production scheduling
	Stock that ran out (zero at end of day)
	Avoid under-buying next time
	Stock leftover at event end
	Avoid over-buying and excess waste
	Production insufficient (had to make more mid-day)
	Better production pre-planning
	Same event vs prior year comparison
	Year-on-year growth tracking
	

Pre-Event Forecast Report
* System asks: 'Are you preparing for [Event Type]?' — suggests based on calendar date
* Shows: Sales data from last 3 occurrences of the same event type
* Recommends: 'Based on Easter 2024 and 2025, you will likely need: T-Bone 45kg, Boerewors 60kg, Lamb Chops 35kg...'
* Owner can adjust recommendations and save as 'Order Plan' for the event
* After the event: system records actuals vs forecast — improves future predictions automatically
